				Hi, I’m Baatyrbek Turatov! I’m a junior at National Louis University, working toward my B.S. in Computer Science & Information Systems. I have a real passion for software development, data analysis, and problem-solving, and I love creating projects that blend technical precision with creativity.<br></br>
				I’ve worked with languages like Java, Python, C++, C, and JavaScript (React, Flask, Three.js, Vite) and explored areas such as data science, machine learning, and cloud technologies. From building interactive applications to analyzing data with TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, I enjoy tackling challenges that uncover insights and make an impact.<br></br>
				Beyond the technical side, I’m always eager to learn, experiment, and grow. Whether it’s exploring DevOps tools like Docker and Kubernetes, improving my database skills with SQL and MySQL, or diving deeper into AI, I stay curious and motivated.<br></br>
				My goal is simple: to keep building meaningful projects that solve problems, improve efficiency, and bring ideas to life.
